# Netflix Clone built using React, GraphQL and DataStax
The frontend is built using React.js, and the movie data is stored using Datastax Astra DB in a cloud environment

Server side code is deployed as API endpoints using Netlify serverless functions

The database is queried using the GraphQL API, and pagination in GraphQL is applied to accommodate devices of different sizes
